   <h5>Blog 15: Complete Overview Assessment</h5>

   Completion Overview:
   <p>
   <b title="Have every student complete a final coding project based on their passions that shows what they learned in the class.">Goal 1:</b> Instead of a final project, we are creating a final portfolio to showcase the various assignments they did in the class. What I originally had in mind for “projects” are now going to be in class assignments that they will get to play around with the last week of class, probably on that Monday before we start diving into RobotC. This portfolio should be complete by the final day of class, March 2nd. I will review it that day and provide the students with feedback.
   </p>

   <p>
   <b title="Give the students a survey about how useful the class was, if they feel that they've grown as a programmer, if it changed their perspectives about coding, etc. Get positive feedback on all those areas by at least 70% of the class.">Goal 2:</b> Gave the students their initial survey on the first day of class. I am now working on putting together the final survey and the deciding upon which questions I should ask to get the most accurate feedback. Some of the questions are the same from the first survey, but just asked again to see growth. Between the first and final surveys, I should have sufficient data to measure changes in their attitudes towards code. I will also be comparing all the productivity scores from the End of Class Feedback sheets I have been collecting from them after every class.
   </p>

   <p>
   <b title="Based on computational learning tests, students will show at least a 50% improvement in computational learning/problem solving by the end of the course.">Goal 3:</b> This one is tricky, as I’m not sure if measuring computational learning after only six class periods is fair to the students and an accurate assessment of their abilities. This was originally operating under the assumption that students would be completing two additional (mini) projects before the end of the course. Things have moved a little slower than I anticipated, however the students still seem to be learning and responding well to the material. I feel that every student having a complete portfolio from this class, with assignments and code snippets that met the original requirements, will be sufficient evidence of both participation and growth in skills. I would like to overwrite this goal with two new ones.
   </p>
   <p>
   I have been considering extending this class as a club after it’s over, so that students that found it especially interesting can continue building upon their skills in a more collaborative environment (rather than trying to continue it at home - which can be daunting for some). Ideally, I would also like to do some programming-outreach to the larger KCS community through this club, perhaps in the form of hosting a ‘Programming Night’, Hackathon, or some other event of that kind. This is partially because I have been receiving promising feedback from my students, so I am considering asking in the final survey whether or not they’d be willing to join a club that continues to build upon this class. The first part of this goal is:</p>
   <h3>Have <b>at least</b> 30% of the students (there are about 60 students, so at least 18 of them) indicate that they’d be interested in joining the club on the final survey. </h3>
   <p>However, there will always be issues with dates, times, etc. when it comes to actually retaining students for a club. If at least 30% of the students are interested, I would like to start the club and move on to the next goal:</p>
   <h3>Retain between 10% (6 students) and 15% (9 students)  of the students from my CodeKCS classes for the CodeKCS club.</h3>
   <p>This is operating under the assumption that we would have a few students from outside of the classes join the club as well (I know a few students in other grades that were interested in the material). While it would be amazing to retain 30% of the students, it might also be a little overwhelming, as the purpose of such a club would be mainly for students to receive more mentorship and one on one help with their coding endeavors. If we were to retain more than 15% of the students AND have a few kids from outside of the classes join, I would possibly need to recruit more help to lead such a big group with varying interests. Or I would have to change the club template to something more similar to a class rather than a club. No matter what, I would love for many of the CodeKCS engineering class students to come to the events hosted by the club. :)
