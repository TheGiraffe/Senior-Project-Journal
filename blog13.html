   Communication
   <img src="images/update_communication.png" width="50%" color="white" border="2px">
   <p>I had a meeting with Mr. Murali yesterday (Feb 5) to discuss the curriculum, logistics of class, resources needed, and other details for my class this friday. I must make sure I communicate all the moving parts to Murali and that I receive his feedback on them to ensure that he’s in the loop and the class is a success. Another big part of this class is communicating effectively with the students. I have to find a way to make the curriculum fun, let my enthusiasm show, and speak loud enough for them to hear me when I’m presenting to the students.</p>
   <br>
   Interpersonal
   <img src="images/update_interpersonal.png" width="50%" color="white" border="2px">
   <p>I have to work well with students and teachers to make the class a success. I’m naturally fairly introverted, but this project has required the help of many other people and, for once, it’s not a project I can do only by myself. This includes doing interviews, surveys, and end of the day check-ins with students to make sure that the students are getting something out of the class. I will also be tweaking the class as I go with student feedback because the students are the users, and the class is the product. Gotta make sure they’re happy with how the class is going.</p>
   <p>Mentorship is also a huge part of this class. I have office hours for both meeting in person and over the web, and my Google chat and Slack channels are always open for students who need help. In general, I plan to go back and forth helping students with their code during class time, as well as checking in with every student here and there to make sure they’re doing alright.</p>
   <p>This class is very student centered; everywhere from the students choosing which projects they want to work on to a teaching approach that focuses on mentorship.</p>
   <br>
   Information
   <img src="images/update_information.png" width="50%" color="white" border="2px">
   <p>I had to brush up on my coding skills and learn new skills to be able to teach this class and hopefully be a good mentor. I also had to learn a lot about teaching - specifically, teaching code, which can be quite a struggle for even professional programmers (sometimes especially for them). </p>
   <p>I read up on a lot of literature about how people teach code, what’s wrong with the current way we teach code, and experimental ideas put forth by educators about how to make the process better for the students. It was inspiring and overwhelming at the same time; I incorporated a lot of these ideas, as well as ideas I received from professional programmers and things I observed from my own experience of learning code to put together this curriculum that I have now.</p>
   <p> I also realized through my research that motive is an important consideration when teaching people code. Nobody wants to feel like they’re being “forced” into a hobby or job pathway that doesn’t interest them. Rather, I feel that it’s important to teach code as a ‘skill’ that students can use to add to their existing interests, and choose to use in the future if they find it useful enough. Not everyone has to (or should) go into STEM, but a STEM education can be inherently valuable.</p>
   <br>
   Thinking & Problem Solving
   <img src="images/update_thinking.png" width="50%" color="white" border="2px">
   <p>Programming is problem solving. You constantly have to debug code, which means figuring out what went wrong, changing something, rinse wash repeat until you solved that problem. Then configure everything else to work around whatever it is you changed, if necessary. Programming is used in the real world to solve problems, all sorts of problems. From a marketing perspective, one could say that there is some functionality in a product that’s missing from the existing products. To solve that problem, you create your own product with that functionality and sell it. But in the bigger picture, that’s really all there is to it. You notice a lack of something somewhere in your workflow and you use this valuable skill to patch it up. You adjust the settings for you open source text editor, or program a website that’s better than the premade ones you’re used to. You make a better program that perfectly fits your needs as opposed than the ones already available, because that is something only you are capable of doing.</p>
   <p>Part of this class is teaching the thought process for coding. We will be teaching some basic logic to the students by having them play with conditionals, booleans, and other programming constructs. These constructs help them learn how to think, not just to think like a computer but to be able to break the world around them into algorithms. It teaches a different perspective that can come in handy with real world problems and can allow them to problem solve more creatively. There’s a reason why I like to say “When in doubt, think like an engineer”. </p>
